# Data-Science-course
exercises and project during the Data Science course

Stepik course "Start in Data Science!"

The main goal of this course is to teach attendees the basics of Python and analytics - for a subsequent successful career in data analytics.
I have no background in computer science but I really want to become a data analyst.
So wish me good luck!)
